# 📊 TIBCO Spotfire-Style Sales Dashboard (Mock Project)

This is a demo project built to simulate a real-world business intelligence dashboard using mock sales data.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel (for data simulation)
- TIBCO Spotfire-style design (chart structure and layout)

## 📁 Files
- `mock_sales_data.csv`: Fake sales data with Region, Category, Month, and Sales
- `sales_by_region.png`: Bar chart showing total sales by region
- `sales_by_category.png`: Bar chart of product category performance
- `monthly_sales_trend.png`: Line chart showing sales trend by month

## 💡 Purpose
To showcase my ability to build insightful dashboards, simulate client requests, and work with visualization tools.

## 🚀 Next Steps
I'm learning TIBCO Spotfire, and this project reflects my progress. More real dashboards to come!
